I used google chrome for testing my website.


For easier navigation, I will explain where each requirement for this project is on the website.


1. The webpages are presentable as a whole; the interface is user-friendly; the website contains pictures or videos.  --20 points

	For the sake of memory I only used 4 pictures for this site. Two pictures are used multiple times throught the site. There is at least one picture on each page.
	There is no copyright on these pictures because all the pictures being used are my cousin's pictures.

2. Website has 1 homepage and at least 3 subpages; the homepage and subpages have a horizontal menu that leads to the other pages.   --10 points

	Every page has the same header and footer with 4 links to the home page plus the 3 subpages.

3. The homepage has picture carousel animation.   --10 points

	The home page (index.html) has a slideshow effect with 3 pictures

4. Have a scroll box in one page.  --10 points

	There is one scroll box on the search page (search.html) that holds all the search artwork.

5.One page has unordered HTML list with several entries.  --10 points

	The home page (index.html) has 5 unordered lists. There are 5 steps with an unordered list below each step. To be able to see all 5 unordered lists you must 
	click on each icon to reveal each list. I used 5 lists instead of one because it helped me explain each step better. 

6. There is a button to download files. --10 points
	
	The download button is located on the image page (art.html), towards the bottom of the page ("Download this picture"), and it is just a link to download the picture 
	that is on display. I chose to be able to download a picture instead of a written file because it fit the theme of my website better.
 
7. There is a link that you can click and leads to outside webpages. --10 points

	There is one link on the profile page (profile.html) that links to my cousin's website. It is located under the "Info" section and says, "Visit Jesse's Website."
